# Clean-Code

**Clean Code Principles**

**1- Low Coupling Principle (SRP)**:
The Low Coupling Principle, promotes the development of modular and maintainable software systems. Low coupling refers to the degree of interdependence or connection between software modules or components within a system. A low coupling principle aims to minimize the dependencies between these modules, making each module more independent and less reliant on the internal details of other modules.

**2- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: 

The Single Responsibility Principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, advocates a simple but powerful concept: a class, method, or module should have one and only one reason to change. In other words, it should have a single responsibility. This principle promotes code organization that is clean, concise, and focused.
