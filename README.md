# Clean-Code

**Clean Code Principles**
**The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The Single Responsibility Principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, advocates a simple but powerful concept: a class, method, or module should have one and only one reason to change. In other words, it should have a single responsibility. This principle promotes code organization that is clean, concise, and focused.
